## ü¶ï Description 

Extinct Earth is an innovative web application created by me as a school project. This application combines a React front-end with a robust Rails back-end to provide an immersive experience centered around the captivating world of extinct animals.

To ensure maximum security, I have integrated the bcrypt gem for robust authorization and protection. Strong params are utilized to add an extra layer of security, ensuring that only valid and sanitized data is accepted. Thorough validations have also been implemented to maintain a clean and reliable database.

One notable feature of this application is the incorporation of a many-to-many relationship, allowing for comprehensive exploration and connections between various extinct animal species. Additionally, I have pushed the boundaries by incorporating Google Maps integration, a topic not typically covered in the Flatiron School curriculum, enhancing the user experience with a unique twist.

Extinct Earth offers a user-friendly interface with multiple pages, providing a wealth of information and captivating content. Users can effortlessly navigate through an extensive collection of extinct animal profiles, and utilize filtering and sorting options to customize their browsing experience. This application provides a comprehensive understanding of our planet's prehistoric inhabitants.

With full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality, users have the power to contribute and interact with the platform, making it a truly dynamic and engaging experience. Whether you're a passionate paleontologist, an avid history enthusiast, or simply curious about the wonders of extinct animals, Extinct Earth is your ultimate destination.

Get ready to embark on a journey through time and explore the rich biodiversity that once flourished on our planet.
